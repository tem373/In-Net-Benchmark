-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> packet.py
very simple, only takes a sequence number (maybe timestamp also?) <--ask

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> simulator.py
primarily takes user parameters and calls the various functions/classes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> network.py
defines functions used in each of the hosts:
send (routers and sender) 
recv (routers and receivers) 
copy (routers only, for multicast traffic) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> sender.py
works the same way in both experiments. Needs to send <1> packet to router1, 
which copies the packet and then sends it onward

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> router.py
Need 1 in the 2 recv experiment, need 3 in the 4 recv experiment (name router1, etc?)

difference between 2 experiments: 
    in 2-recv, router1 sends to receivers
    in 4-recv, router1 sends to router2 and router3, which both send to recvs
    <in essence, 4-recv just adds a new type of router>
    
also, needs to replicate the packets (just once in every case)

not sure how best to implement the sending route

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> receiver.py
basically just receives the packet, with some additional functionality
(reporting, etc)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> host.py
implement with these functionalities:

send()
recv()
duplicate()
