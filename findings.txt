1. The gap between the in-network and tomography approaches is most when you
have a small number of probes (but it can't be too small because then both will
be erroneous). You typically use a small number of probes when the link
conditions change quickly. So this says that the gap is most when link
conditions change quickly.

2. The gap between the two approaches is most when the tree depth is high. This
is again represented by Figure 6 in the MINC paper.

3. To get the best accuracy from the in-network approach, we should send
independent probes on each link of the tree, instead of sending one multicast
probe through the whole tree like the tomography approach does. Put
differently, in the in-network approach, you instrument just those links that
are likely to be problematic; you don't need to setup an entire multicast tree.

4. The gap between the in-network and tomography approaches goes up as the link
loss probability goes up because the probability of a probe being lost
simultaneously on two sibling links goes up. The reason simultaneous losses is
important is because the tomography approach can't resolve ambiguity in these
cases and blames the losses on the parent link.

5. The errors are better for the tomography approach (relative to the
in-network approach) when presented with bursty losses from the Gilbert-Elliot
model. I don't understand this myself. I think it might be a function of how
high the loss rate is.
