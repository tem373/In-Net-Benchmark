Some findings:

1. The gap between the in-network and tomography approaches is most when you have a small number of probes. You typically use a small number of probes when the link conditions change quickly. So in a way this says that the gap is most when link conditions change quickly.

2. The gap between the two approaches is most when the tree depth is high. This is again represented by Figure 6 in the paper.

3. The error in both approaches goes as 1/sqrt(n), but the constant of proportionality is higher for the tomography approach relative to the SDN one.

4. To get the best accuracy from the in-network approach, we should send independent probes on each link of the tree, instead of sending one multicast probe through the whole tree.

5. The gap between the in-network and tomography approaches goes up as the link loss probability goes up because the probability of a probe being lost simultaneously on two sibling links goes up. The reason simultaneous losses is important is because the tomography approach can't resolve ambiguity in these cases and blames the losses on the parent link.
